The event structure will be like:

Server/Cook doing event | Type of Event | Order that Event is happening on | Notes? maybe idk

Event types will be:

takeOrder
cookConfirmOrder
cookFinishedOrder
tableReceivedOrder
tableRejectedOrder
tableRequestedBill

Notes will have either order info or reason why order was rejected

ex:

1 | takeOrder |  | 4 - Burger x 2, fries x 1

1 | cookConfirmOrder | 2 |
