This is a project built to organize and manage a Restaurant

It was built over the span of about 2 months in a team of 4 using Java to build the backend system of the restaurant, and JavaFX to run the GUI and desktop application.

I was the project manager and was in charge of coming up with the overall design and ensuring things were on schedule, and built according to plan.
