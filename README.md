This is a project built to organize and manage a Restaurant

It was built over the span of about 2 months in a team of 4 using Java to build the backend system of the restaurant, and JavaFX to run the GUI and desktop application.

I was the project manager and was in charge of coming up with the overall design and ensuring things were on schedule, and built according to plan.

The focus of the project was extensible, modular, design and we adhered to SOLID design principles and established design patterns to build robust, resuable code. Consider taking a look at the many [UML Diagrams](https://github.com/Saamoz/RestaurantProject/tree/master/UmlDesigns) created to help manage and keep track of our code.
